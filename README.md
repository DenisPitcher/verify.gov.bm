# verify.gov.bm
A simple verifier app for Bermuda's paper verifiable credentials based upon the PathCheck Foundations's [Paper Verifiable Credentials](https://github.com/Path-Check/paper-cred) standard 

## Overview

This app has been created to support Bermuda's efforts for verifiable certificates and keys.  It is designed to allow for Bermuda issued Covid-19 Vaccine and PCR Test certificates to be easily verifiable.  It also supports Bermuda's SafeKey program for allowing individuals to share their Covid-19 Status as a means to access services or activities that may be restricted or limited by COVID-19 Regulations.

## SafeKey Program
